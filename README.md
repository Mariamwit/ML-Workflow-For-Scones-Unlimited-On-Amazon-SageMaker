# ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker

<h1> Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker  </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, an image classification model is built that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations.
The goal is to ship a scalable and safe model. 

In this project,  AWS Sagemaker is used to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. The model is deplyoed using AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, and AWS Step Functions to compose the model and services into an event-driven application.
