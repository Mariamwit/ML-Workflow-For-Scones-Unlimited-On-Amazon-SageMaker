# Resistance

<h1> Calculating Resistance in Ohms and Kilo-ohms Using Color Bands  </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
A resistor is a circuit-device designed to have a specific resistance value between its
ends. Resistors are color-coded with 3 bands. The first two band colors represent digits and the third
band represents the multiplier. The resistance is calculated by multiplying the first digit by 10, adding the 2nd digit, and applying the
multiplier. So if the first band is red, the second band is brown, and the third band is yellow, then the
first digit is 2, the second digit is 1, and the multiplier is 104. The resistance value is then calculated
as (2 * 10 + 1) * 104.

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
The program asks the user to enter the colors of the 3 bands, then calculates the resistance in
ohms and kilo-ohms.: <br/>
